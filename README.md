Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas and Numpy

Project Description:
This project focuses on utilizing Python's Pandas and Numpy libraries to clean and manipulate a provided dataset, preparing it for analysis. The dataset includes columns such as Age, Salary, Rating, Location, Established, and Easy Apply. The key objectives of the project are to handle missing values, address outliers, standardize data types, and ensure data integrity.

Steps and Highlights:

Missing Values:
Imputed missing values in the 'Age' column with the mean.
Extracted numeric values from the 'Salary' column and imputed missing values with the mean.

Data Types:
Converted 'Established' to datetime and 'Rating' to float.

Outliers:
Identified and handled outliers in the 'Rating' column using Z-score.

Salary Formatting:
Formatted and standardized the 'Salary' column during missing values handling.

Location Standardization:
Converted 'Location' entries to lowercase for consistency.

Established Column:
Explored and handled any inconsistencies in the 'Established' column.

Easy Apply Indicator:
Transformed 'Easy Apply' column values to boolean for better analysis.

Rating Range:
Addressed outliers in the 'Rating' column using Z-score.

Age Distribution:
Checked and handled unusual entries in the 'Age' column during missing values handling.

Handling Special Characters:
Removed non-alphanumeric characters from the 'Location' column.

Data Integrity:
Cross-referenced entries to ensure data integrity and identify inconsistencies.

Easy Apply Transformation:
Transformed 'Easy Apply' to boolean values for consistency.

Location Accuracy:
Assessed and corrected misspelled or ambiguous locations.

Handling Categorical Data:
Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Consistent Rating Scale:
Normalized the 'Rating' column for a consistent scale.

Data Validation:
Performed sanity checks on key variables and relationships within the data.

Project Outcome:
The cleaned dataset is saved as 'cleaned_dataset.csv'. The entire cleaned dataset is displayed, and the code is well-documented to facilitate understanding and reproducibility. This project serves as a foundational exercise for data cleaning and manipulation skills using Pandas and Numpy, essential in any data analytics role.
